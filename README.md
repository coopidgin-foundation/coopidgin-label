# coopidgin-label
The coopidgin label is a proposition of label for international auxiliary language communities wich think documentation should be open-source and which want to try self-management by polls.

## Rules
An auxlang with the label coopidgin means:

1. The main documentation is published under open-source license and the sources are available.
2. The language evolution is made by polls. All speakers can vote and submite new polls.
3. The documentation informs about some other auxiliary language projects, and does not claim that its project is the best.

Currently, there is no auxiliary language project that really meet these three criteria.

## Purpose
The purpose of this label is to allow every speaker (in just a few mouse clicks):

1. to takeover an abandoned project.
2. to contribute to the evolution of a living project.
3. to fork a project to experience some modifications on it, or to create a new language.

## Conclusion

Do not hesitate to register on GitHub. You can thus contribute to improve the definition of the label "coopidgin" by editing the files and sending a pull request (a validation request).

You can also join the "coopidgin-foundation" group to be able to edit and validate the files directly. You can write in "Markdown" markup language, which is intuitive, or write in plain text if you prefer.

And above all, here you can create repositories to host your language projects, if you have no place elsewhere.

Coopidgin languages would belong to everyone and would be quickly to improve or to recycle. So please give them a chance.
