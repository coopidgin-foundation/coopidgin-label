# coopidgin-label
A proposition of label for auxlangs with open-source documentation and self-management community.

An auxlang with the label coopidgin means that:

1. The documentation is published under open-source license and the sources are available.

2. The language is evolutive. All speakers can vote and submite new polls.

3. The documentation presents other auxiliary language projects, and does not claim that its project is the best.

Currently, there are still no auxiliary languages that meet these three criteria.
